                    <p>At Accessible Adventure we have the desire to share the natural spaces around the Cornish Coastline 
                        with everyone. This includes sharing the experience with children and young people who have additional 
                        needs or are otherwise neuro-divergent.

                <p>We will take you exploring the dramatic and historic Cornish Coastline around Newquay. 
                    You could be exploring smugglers caves, be swirled around in natural whirlpools, experience tidal rise and fall 
                    in "The Chimney", swim through "Gollum's Cave", and test yourself with the three levels at "Triple". </p>

                    like the opportunity to explore the coastline with people who have experience in providing memorable,
